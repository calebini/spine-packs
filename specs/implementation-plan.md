# Installer Implementation Plan

## Status and authority

This document sequences implementation of the installer contract in
`specs/installer.md` and `specs/installer-artifacts.md`. Those documents remain
normative when this plan is incomplete or imprecise. A listed slice is not
authorization to implement it; each slice requires separate review and
authorization before runtime scope expands.

The delivery strategy is deliberately vertical. Each slice must leave a usable,
tested boundary and must not introduce behavior assigned to a later slice.

## Delivery sequence

### Slice 1: read-only planning — complete

Implemented in `src/spine_packs/`:

- validate the complete manifest and sealed install request;
- resolve an exact selection and compatible local Spine target;
- query only the pinned public read-command surface;
- classify missing, equivalent, drifted, and blocked desired state;
- emit a deterministic, private, no-clobber plan artifact; and
- reject write commands at the subprocess boundary.

This slice has synthetic runtime and independent contract coverage. It has not
been qualified against a live operator target.

### Slice 2: apply preflight without writes — complete

Add the internal apply-preflight service boundary while keeping all Spine writes
disabled. Do not expose the public `apply` CLI command until Slice 3:

- validate and correlate the saved plan, approval, and complete manifest;
- require an apply-eligible released plan and complete action authorization;
- resolve and revalidate the exact local target and execution-contract union;
- repeat `system.info`, catalog collection, snapshot, and selected-object
  precondition checks;
- validate the complete ordered command templates and all IDs that can be
  materialized before execution;
- classify stale, incompatible, blocked, draft, and incompletely authorized
  attempts using the specified result envelope and exit behavior; and
- prove with negative tests that no subprocess write command can be launched.

Exit gate: every preflight failure is deterministic and non-mutating, and a
successful preflight produces only an in-memory execution-ready description.
It does not create a checkpoint or submit a Spine write.

### Slice 3: initial apply and durable checkpointing — implemented; bounded review complete

Enable an approved initial write sequence:

- establish the stable execution identity, actor, action timestamp, and
  reproducible command IDs;
- atomically publish the prepared checkpoint before each command submission;
- submit only the closed, validated Spine write-command set;
- validate and durably preserve each response before advancing;
- materialize generated-ID references only from validated prior responses;
- stop on the first rejection or malformed response; and
- emit `applied`, `partial`, or `not_applied` terminal results without
  compensation or rollback claims.

Exit gate: fault-injection tests cover every boundary between checkpoint
publication, command submission, response validation, and checkpoint advance.

The initial-only implementation is in `apply.py` and `execution.py`, with a
separate transport write allowlist and explicit CLI checkpoint/output paths.
Tests cover all six write commands, exact receipt/request correlation,
independent checkpoint/result contract validation, binding precondition changes,
empty-prefix partial failure, preflight refusal, no-write plans, and filesystem
publication failures. Qualification uses simulated commands only. Preserve any
interrupted checkpoint; same-execution continuation is implemented in Slice 4 below.
Bounded review returned no blockers or major findings and one minor
owner-template validation gap. The gap is addressed by uniform exact-plan-owner
checks and negative contract/runtime vectors, including unreferenced creates.
The follow-up patch is regression-tested, not separately re-audited. No real
installation, pack release, or deployment is implied.

### Slice 4: continuation and uncertain-response recovery — implemented; bounded review complete

Resume an interrupted execution without broadening its authority:

- validate checkpoint or terminal partial-result correlation;
- reconstruct the accepted prefix and its exact expected catalog state;
- distinguish the normal prefix state from the single permitted uncertain
  first-unresolved-action state;
- reuse the original command ID and exact semantic request;
- require compatible replay or new acceptance before advancing; and
- reject gaps, unrelated catalog changes, changed approvals, or altered
  execution facts.

Exit gate: restart tests cover every action boundary, including an accepted
write whose response was not durably recorded. No failed or stale execution can
skip, reorder, or regenerate an action.

`recovery.py` validates the saved checkpoint or partial result, exhausts fresh
public readback, checks full selected definitions and available provenance,
and compares inverse fingerprints under Section 9.1. Recompiling the original
plan from reconstructed semantic preimages checks the remaining suffix and
untouched selected definitions. Only one candidate may pass. `apply.py` shares
the durable execution loop with initial apply; provisional readback facts must
match the retry response before acceptance is recorded.

The CLI takes `apply --continue-from SOURCE` and fresh checkpoint/result paths,
preserving the recovery source. Simulated tests cover all six command kinds,
every prepared/advanced checkpoint boundary, response loss after commit,
partial-result continuation, unrelated changes, semantic/provenance mismatch,
replay-ID mismatch, binding changes before retry, and publication failures.
These are synthetic tests, not real-target qualification. The bounded review
passed with one package-docstring nit, subsequently patched; no runtime change
was needed. The review artifacts are in `whetstone_runs/installer-slice4-audit-001/`.

### Slice 5: non-mutating verification — implemented; bounded review complete

Implement `verify` independently of apply execution:

- reload and correlate the plan, manifest, target, and optional apply result;
- freshly read selected archetypes, profiles, and bindings;
- verify semantic desired state and selection scope;
- correlate captured command responses and receipt facts without claiming
  later authoritative receipt-row readback; and
- emit the closed verification artifact and specified result status.

Exit gate: verification performs no write or compatible-replay request and
detects target, state, evidence, and correlation mismatches.

`verification.py` and the source-tree `verify` CLI implement selected-state
comparison independently of apply execution. The CLI requires an explicit
manifest and saved plan, accepts an optional apply result, and writes a new
sealed verification artifact. Captured response coverage is distinct from
fresh catalog equivalence. Missing/invalid evidence cannot be repaired by a
write or replay. No-write plans require no receipts. Whole-owner observation
retains read validation and consistency checks without treating unrelated
catalog changes as verification failures.

Focused tests cover all six command response kinds, complete/missing/invalid
coverage, no-write and granular plans, drift and retirement, changed root IDs,
equivalent later revisions, malformed readback, target/compatibility failures,
CLI exits and protected paths, and the read-only transport boundary. Independent
contract checks cover exact ordered object coverage and evidence states.
The bounded review passed with no blockers or majors, one minor CLI-synopsis
clarification, and one stale test-name nit. Both were patched in `490c298`;
the follow-up passed 55 contract and 106 runtime tests, without runtime changes.
The patch has not been separately re-audited. No pack or installer is released.

### Slice 6: end-to-end qualification and supported packaging — local packaging added; review pending

The operator authorized kickoff with an isolated throwaway ledger. Start with
local integration qualification; packaging follows only after the source-tree
workflow qualifies. No existing ledger, daemon, cloud deployment, checkout
mutation, or public release is authorized by this test pass.

The first disposable-ledger pass exercises real Spine 0.3.0 public commands
against an isolated installation of the inspected commit. It covers normal
installation, retain and granular planning, drift authorization/refusal,
staleness, verification mismatch, terminal partial-result continuation, and
uncertain-response recovery for all six write kinds. The harness retains all
local evidence and does not modify runtime code, Spine, or curated packs.
Setup, reproducible invocation, evidence, and limits are documented in
`docs/local-qualification.md`. The initial pass passed four integration tests
(including six separate uncertain-response command scenarios), 55 contract
tests, 106 synthetic runtime tests, and repository/whitespace checks.
Local wheel/sdist packaging and an installed console entrypoint are now
authorized for GitHub distribution. `scripts/qualify_package.py` checks archive
contents, rebuilds from the sdist, and runs the disposable suite through a
clean installed CLI outside the checkout. See `docs/releases.md` for the
procedure and remaining version/license/publication choices. The initial
clean-installed candidate passed all four integration tests, including the six
uncertain-response subcases, on macOS/Python 3.14.6. Source checks passed 55
contract tests and 109 runtime tests. Direct and sdist-built wheels matched
byte-for-byte. These are working-tree candidate results. The final
clean-commit qualification and bounded completion-gate review remain pending;
this is not completion of Slice 6 or a public release.

Harden the complete local v1 workflow:

- run plan, approval, initial apply, interrupted continuation, and verify
  scenarios against an isolated disposable Spine ledger through public
  commands only;
- exercise missing, equivalent, authorized drift, rejected drift, stale plan,
  partial apply, uncertain response, and verification mismatch cases;
- confirm artifact permissions, no-clobber behavior, byte and time bounds, and
  secret-safe diagnostics; and
- define the supported package and entrypoint only after the source-tree
  workflow qualifies.

Exit gate: contract, runtime, fault-injection, clean-install, and disposable
integration checks pass from a clean checkout. Release of either the installer
or a pack remains a separate decision.

## Deferred hardening

The following remain explicit follow-ups rather than hidden v1 prerequisites:

- stable Spine ledger-instance identity;
- atomic compare-and-set for binding replacement;
- public command-receipt readback;
- remote transport;
- multi-writer reconciliation; and
- cryptographic approval or Foreman integration.

If one becomes necessary for a delivery slice, update the owning Spine and
Spine Packs contracts before implementation rather than weakening the stated
local, single-operator boundary.

## Per-slice completion rule

A slice is complete only when its normative references, machine contracts,
runtime behavior, focused tests, repository verification, documentation, and
working-tree review agree. Commit and push are separate operator decisions.
