# Repository instructions

These instructions apply throughout this repository.

## Read first

Before changing pack behavior or format, read:

1. `specs/overview.md`
2. `specs/architecture.md`
3. `specs/compatibility.md`
4. `specs/pack-format.md`

Before changing `kinflow-starter` content, also read `specs/kinflow-starter.md`.

The files in `specs/` are the normative source of truth. `README.md` is
orientation, pack-local READMEs describe pack status, and code must implement
rather than redefine the specs.

## Authority boundaries

- Spine is the sole authority for installed archetypes, notification profiles,
  bindings, receipts, and ownership.
- Treat packs as declarative, owner-neutral content. Never embed owner IDs,
  delivery targets, subjects, routes, credentials, or environment-specific
  facts in reusable pack content.
- Any future installer must interact with Spine only through Spine's existing
  public command surface. Direct database access is forbidden.
- Do not implement a ledger, scheduler, daemon, or competing runtime here.
- Do not make Spine runtime changes from this repository or modify a Spine
  checkout as part of spine-packs work.
- Do not mutate a released pack version. Add a new version and preserve the
  released artifact.

## Stage discipline

This is a draft-contract repository. The current scope is limited to
`spine.pack-manifest.v1` and the medical-appointment and lesson vertical slices.
Do not broaden the schema or pack semantics without matching normative spec,
fixture, and contract-test changes. Do not add an installer implementation,
package runtime, or speculative service/adapter/model/package directories.
Mark unresolved design details explicitly instead of silently choosing them.

When the repository advances, add only the smallest structure required by real
artifacts. Machine-readable public agreements belong in `contracts/`; runtime
implementation belongs in an explicitly reviewed package layout; explanatory
material belongs in `docs/` only when the README is insufficient.

## Change checks

For documentation-only and seed-structure changes, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_repo.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/contract -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

If a future change introduces executable behavior or a contract, add focused
tests appropriate to that behavior. The repository verifier is a handoff and
structure check, not a substitute for behavior or contract tests.
