# Repository instructions

These instructions apply throughout this repository.

## Read first

Before changing pack behavior or format, read:

1. `specs/overview.md`
2. `specs/architecture.md`
3. `specs/compatibility.md`
4. `specs/pack-format.md`

Before changing `kinflow-starter` content, also read `specs/kinflow-starter.md`.
Before changing installer behavior or artifacts, also read
`specs/installer.md` and `specs/installer-artifacts.md`.

The files in `specs/` are the normative source of truth. `README.md` is
orientation, pack-local READMEs describe pack status, and code must implement
rather than redefine the specs.

## Authority boundaries

- Spine is the sole authority for installed archetypes, notification profiles,
  bindings, receipts, and ownership.
- Treat packs as declarative, owner-neutral content. Never embed owner IDs,
  delivery targets, subjects, routes, credentials, or environment-specific
  facts in reusable pack content.
- Any future installer must interact with Spine only through Spine's existing
  public command surface. Direct database access is forbidden.
- Do not implement a ledger, scheduler, daemon, or competing runtime here.
- Do not make Spine runtime changes from this repository or modify a Spine
  checkout as part of spine-packs work.
- Do not mutate a released pack version. Add a new version and preserve the
  released artifact.

## Stage discipline

This is a draft-contract repository. The current scope is limited to
`spine.pack-manifest.v1`, the draft installer behavior and machine artifacts in
`specs/installer.md` and `specs/installer-artifacts.md`, and the
medical-appointment, lesson,
game-or-competition, flight, birthday, Education, Social, Travel, and Renewals
and administration, Health, and Home, vehicle, and logistics vertical slices
plus the General commitments vertical slice specified for `kinflow-starter`
draft 9.
Do not broaden the schema or pack semantics without matching normative spec,
fixture, and contract-test changes. The authorized runtime scope is the bounded
read-only `plan`, non-mutating apply preflight, Slice 3 initial approved
`apply` with durable checkpointing, and Slice 4 same-execution continuation and
bounded uncertain-response recovery in `src/spine_packs/`, described in
`specs/architecture.md`. Testing these slices uses simulated commands; executing
an actual installation requires a separately supplied target, released pack,
and exact approval. Do not add `verify`, broader recovery, remote
transport, release packaging, or speculative service/adapter/model directories
without separate review and authorization. Planning must retain its strict
read-command allowlist; apply may use only the six reviewed write commands.
Mark unresolved design details explicitly instead of silently choosing them.

When the repository advances, add only the smallest structure required by real
artifacts. Machine-readable public agreements belong in `contracts/`; runtime
implementation belongs in an explicitly reviewed package layout; explanatory
material belongs in `docs/` only when the README is insufficient.

## Change checks

For documentation, contract, and planner changes, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_repo.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/contract -p 'test_*.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/runtime -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

If a future change introduces executable behavior or a contract, add focused
tests appropriate to that behavior. The repository verifier is a handoff and
structure check, not a substitute for behavior or contract tests.
